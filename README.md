# MicroPython-Humidity-Logging
MicroPython code to log environmental information to things speak

This code is designed to read the environment information:- Humidity, Air Pressure and Temperature from a BMP058 and log that information
to Things Speak.

You will need a Things Speak account.

I have built this on a WiPy but there is no reason this shouldnt run on any other system capable of runining Micro Python
